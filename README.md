# rainalert
Built a program that sends me a text when it is raining at 7am in the morning everyday and it reminds me to take an umbrella. Used OpenWeather api to get the weather
information for my current location and Twilio Api to enable me send text messages. My authentication(apikey, auth_token, account_sid) was done with free accounts so it does not matter if people try to access it
